\section{Service Architecture - Software Engineering}
\subsection{Context}
3 courses : \\
The SOAP standard: In this course, you have studied the SOA architecture, the web service technology and its standards. \\
RESTFull services: \\
Microservices: How can monolithic applications can be limiting in developping flexible and scalable applications. I have studied SOA and REST architecture and what they bring to overcome the monolithic issues. Finally, I have discovered the Microservices architectures that extends the SOA architecture.
